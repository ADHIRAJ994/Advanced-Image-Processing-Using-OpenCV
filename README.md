# Advanced-Image-Processing-Using-OpenCV
Edge detection is a core concept in **image processing** that helps computers identify shapes and structures within images.   This project uses OpenCV to detect these edges using algorithm like **Canny** filter.
It can be applied to both **static images** and **real-time webcam feeds**, making it ideal for understanding how computers interpret visual boundaries and shapes.  
Edge detection is a core step in applications like object recognition, motion tracking, and facial analysis.
