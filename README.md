# Advanced-Image-Processing-Using-OpenCV
Edge detection is a core concept in **image processing** that helps computers identify shapes and structures within images.   This project uses OpenCV to detect these edges using algorithm like **Canny** filter.   It works on both static images and real-time webcam feeds, making it ideal for understanding how edges define object outlines.
